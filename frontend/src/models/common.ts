/* 
Calling code of a Model's business logic can request the depth of the data of interest, controlling how much of the component instances 
to return from the back-end's object manager, Mongoose.

Depth-varying properties are documented as 'expandable' properties.

By default, the properties are curtailed, or more simply, not expanded; curtailed properties solely return the ID of the containing objects.
